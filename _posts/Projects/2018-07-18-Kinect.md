## Introduction
In this project, a RGB-D human video-emotion dataset collected by Kinect2.0 is introduced. Comparing with the single RGB-view used in most video-emotion datasets, Depth view has unique advantages by introducing spatial and depth information of the field. This datasets consists of 4k clips of RGB videos and 4k clips of Depth videos that correspond to each other, which belong to 7 emotion categories. Then we extracted the C3D feature for this dataset, and did some other processes. 

## My works
* Kinect2.0 research and algorithm design. 
* Dataset acquisition. 
* Data Processing. 

## 1. Algorithm design

### 1.1. Align with RGB view and Depth view
Video streams of RGB and Depth view provided by Kinect2.0 have different visions and resolutions. To meet the requirement of our project, I align the two views by resizing, intercepting and moving. After that, the skeleton points and their connections are drawn on the streams, as shown below.

## 1.2. Save data with high frame rate
Kinect2.0 has a frame rate of 30 Hz officially, while the highest frame rate I can detect in experiments is 20 Hz. I optimize the algorithms, get all of the data firstly and save them in the end, instead of getting and saving at the same time. Then I get a stable frame rate of 15 Hz.
